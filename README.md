# About the Minecraft Remote Project

Minecraft Remote (or mc-remote) is a remote control system for Minecraft. The client communicates with a dedicated server provided by [the McRemote plugin](https://github.com/Naohiro2g/McRemote/)—which runs alongside your PaperMC server—while the API facilitates user interaction, allowing users to write code and perform automatic construction.

It is based on projects such as `RaspberryJuice` by zhowei, `mcpi` by martinohanlon, and `JuicyraspberryPie` by wensheng—all of which are designed to **"support LEARNING"** rather than conventional **"EDUCATION"**, and reflect the collective wisdom and effort of their communities. **The project is also strongly influenced by Dr. Mitchel Resnick (MIT)'s Lifelong Kindergarten.**

## The Clear Mission of the Minecraft Remote Project

### To Support the Acquisition of a Self-Learning Approach (for Beginners)

**The primary goal is to foster a self-directed, exploratory learning approach** rather than merely focusing on technical skills.

### Technical Skills Acquired Through the Self-Learning Approach

- Coding concepts and techniques
- Techniques for open source development using Git/GitHub
- Techniques for realizing/expressing one's own ideas

### Key Points for Maintaining Motivation in Self-Learning

- Provide **the latest version of Minecraft** as an engaging playground and sandbox.
- Enable the reuse of code assets developed from previous projects.
- Support a wide range of programming languages including Python, Scratch, C#, Java, etc. **We are currently prioritizing the preparation of a Scratch version.**
- Expand beyond the Minecraft world to include 3D environments like Unity, Blender, and Houdini.
- Supports output to 3D worlds and plans to support input—enabling interactive experiences that connect digital, real, and other virtual worlds.
- Integrate artificial intelligence technologies. For instance, allow playing rock-paper-scissors with hand gestures in the Minecraft world using computer vision and machine learning.
