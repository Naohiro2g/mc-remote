# About the Minecraft Remote Project

Minecraft Remote (or mc-remote) is a remote control system for Minecraft. The client communicates with a dedicated server provided by [the McRemote plugin](https://github.com/Naohiro2g/McRemote/)—which runs alongside your PaperMC server—while the API facilitates user interaction, allowing users to write code and perform automatic construction.
